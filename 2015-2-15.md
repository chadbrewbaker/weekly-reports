# Weekly report, week 6 of 2015

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
  * iOS dev to get the app out of the way
   * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition. 
   * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
   * Annotate more species on paper
   * Meet up with KS
   * Some Rubycheck code
   * Some cppcheck code 
 
## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?
  * Wrestled with google docs to get dirapp data.
  * Got a graphviz off the dep XML.
  * Started reading Conceptual Mathematics. The lack of concrete transformations is annoying but the naming of properties is interesting.
  * B got back in touch
  * Started an Isratel template and Smolov volume. Good so far.


## (2a) What questions did you come up with?
  * What percentage of GL2N are forgetful functions?
  * Would it be useful to generatively test C++ factory functions for safe destructions? 
  * Could you make a species calculator app?

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?
   * KS flaked out. 
   * Bad iOS docs, I think the Dietel book is the answer
   * Lost hearing. Pred this weekend then allergy shots next month.


## (4) What is your plan for next week?
      * iOS picker/image/text
      * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
      * Annotate more species on paper
      * Get back to B

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * UNL automated test conference with deadline in May? TDD with Combinatorial Species : Generating complex tests with good coverage in a few lines of code. 
  * Two notes? One on polyBernouli species and one on endofunction detection?
