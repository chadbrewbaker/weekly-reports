# Weekly report, week 2 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
         * Come up with ideas for SWDSM. Something gitty and haskelly?
         * Keep up with reactive programming talks
         * More progress on the transformation combinatorics project. Probably graph visualization.


## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * More Reactive Programming Scala course

  * Read up on finger tree reductions, lvars, and CRDTs. I respectfully disagree with LK, monotone semilattice a la Tarski is not enough
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaster-Tarski_theorem . You need stronger non-local conditions to have determinism.
  Example mult(3,4) = 12  it's monotone but since it blows way past 4 you get a huge gap.


## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?


## (4) What is your plan for next week?
    * Startup weekend
    * More progress on the transformation combinatorics project. Probably graph visualization.
    * Count monotone semilatices that are not deterministic with respect to order of element right multiplication
    * Git repo for IRB talk


## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

* SWDSM this weekend
* Iowa Ruby Brigade talk in December on WATIR ;need to make a git repo for the kata and slides
* Still no CFP for @RubyMidwest yet
* ICPP deadline in March
