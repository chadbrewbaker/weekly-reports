# Weekly report, week 42 of 2015

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
   * 01 Avoidence mat to FSA code

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?   
  

## (2a) What questions did you come up with?
  *Better tooling for concolic testing in JVM/JS?  
  *Is ELM a viable test framework for JS?
  *Is ELM through FFI viable for implementing JS methods?
  *Can you do FFI with Excel?
  *Are transfer function matrices of graphs unique up to graph isomorphism? The input adjacency mats are.
  *What do transfer function matrices of trees look like? Cycles?

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?
  *TDD with static java funcs, subclassed IO to fakes.

## (4) What is your plan for next week?
  * Prioritize 01 avoidence stuff for BB 
  * Stackage stuff on AWS Lambda
  * DC Logo in Diagrams

## (4b) What shiny stuff would you like to work on?
  * Endoscope on small Z2 matmul
  * DFS on some combinatorial species grammars
  * DC Fib lambda service behind long tail gateway
  * Generating function mats of all small connected graphs

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?
  
  * Paper with BB on 01 avoidence
  * Talk for Iowa Code Camp or Lambda Conf? Lambda on Lambda, Generating Fun: Playing with Streams
