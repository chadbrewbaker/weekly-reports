## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
  * Touch base with KS
  * More work on porting Clojure Test.Check to Ruby

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Got in touch with KS who gave me CIT cites and a list of questions to write
  * More work on porting Clojure Test.Check to Ruby


## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

 * 

## (4) What is your plan for next week?
  * Read through Myra Cohen's papers on CIT
  * Work on the exact formula for min brute force endofunction detection
  * Gather up the generative testing cites
  * Gather up the iterated endofunction cites from Rota's paper
  * Gather up cites on endofunction combinatorial species
  * More work on porting Clojure Test.Check into Ruby minitest

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * It should give me a better idea of what paper I want to target with the generative testing.
  * The CIT lit review will also be a good bridge between category theory land and software testing folks.
