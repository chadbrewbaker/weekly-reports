# Weekly report, week 3 of 2015

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
 * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition.
  * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
  * Write up the list of questions KS wanted.
  * Read the paper on computational category theory
  * Get some coding done on the ruby check library.
  * Get a copy of 'Sheaf Semantics for Concurrent Interacting Objects'
  * Haskellcast on Conal
  * Typetheorycast on HoTT

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?
  * Listened to Haskellcast by Conal
  * Read some of Conal's blog (Denotational matmul, CartClosedCats) 
  * Read more computational category theory
  * Read Barutz' latest article on Functors
  * Reread Code Complete from cover to cover

## (2a) What questions did you come up with?
  * Does TDD production code have detectable statistical signatures in large VCS?
  * What is the complexity given a finite diagram (arrows, objects) to test if it is a valid category?
  * Is there a category theory model of FRP vs callbacks?
  * What exotic species exist in current codebases?
  * Can we write a static checker that warns when a subset of our code is not a legal category?
  * Given function compositions we know are not categorical (associative), can we use species to find computationaly cheap tests to detect if this non-associativeity leads to bugs?
  * Can we extract diagrams (arrows, objects) from tools like strace?
  * Can we clangformat complex statements into different lines to get better gcov feedback?
  * Order of magnitute performance guarentee benchmarks inside unit tests?
  * Fowler and CC refactorings into category theory?
 

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?
   * Not much coding
   * Just tired all week
 
## (4) What is your plan for next week?
   * Read up on cites in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics looking for semantics based on endofunctions
   * Understand http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/06/17/exponentials-currying-and-universal-constructions/
   * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition.
   * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
   * Write up the list of questions KS wanted.
   * Some Rubycheck code
   * Some cppcheck code 


## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * UNL automated test conference with deadline in May? TDD with Combinatorial Species : Generating complex tests with good coverage in a few lines of code. 
  * Two notes? One on polyBernouli species and one on endofunction detection?
