# Weekly report, week 2 of 2015

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
  * Read through Myra Cohen's papers on CIT
  * Work on the exact formula for min brute force endofunction detection
  * Gather up the generative testing cites
  * Gather up the iterated endofunction cites from Rota's paper
  * Gather up cites on endofunction combinatorial species
  * More work on porting Clojure Test.Check into Ruby minitest

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?
  * Read through Myra Cohen's papers on CIT
  * Read Hughes' papers on QuickCheck
  * Read up on SmallCheck
  * Read up on SmartCheck
  * Read papers on concolic testing
  * Read papers on combinatorial species
  * Browsed some computational category theory
  * Learned that Ruby has a Coverage module build in
  * Learned there was an automated test confrenece at UNL with a deadline this May
  * Contributed a compression distance pull request to Mike Feathers' repository analysis repo
  * Saw Kerr's talk on Rantly
  * Saw Grenning's talk on why unit tests are important (Toyota as example)
  * Read the first chapter of the new MEAP book on FRP
  * Read up on algorithms for point location queries
  * Got the code for THRLMP working, played around with generating functions
  * Found Claesson's spe library and started to play around with it

## (2a) What questions did you come up with?
  * Can you make a purity analizer for Hask/Ruby/C that colors pure code like gcov?
  * Is there a simple testable data structure for O(log n) point interesection queries 10k triangles?
  * If you make a CVT of code coverage hamming distance is it usefull?
  * If you make a CVT of code compression distance between files is it usefull?
  * Would a refactoring tool that auto-curried functions based on variable binding distributions be useful?
  * Any good complexity metrics based on inheritence higherarchies?
  * Complexity metric of inheritence vs composition?
  * Would a dependency treeview or gcov treeview be usefull?
  * What is the complexity cost of PIMPL in C++?
  * Can we emerically detect TDD code in a repo?
  * What combinatorial species to poly-Bernoulli sets belong to?

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?

 * Information overload
 * Lots of reading not much coding

## (4) What is your plan for next week?
  * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition. 
  * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
  * Write up the list of questions KS wanted.
  * Read the paper on computational category theory
  * Get some coding done on the ruby check library.
  * Get a copy of 'Sheaf Semantics for Concurrent Interacting Objects'
  * Haskellcast on Conal
  * Typetheorycast on HoTT

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * UNL automated test conference with deadline in May? TDD with Combinatorial Species : Generating complex tests with good coverage in a few lines of code.
