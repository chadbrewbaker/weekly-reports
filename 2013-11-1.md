# Weekly report, week 0 of 2013

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?

    * Plan, what plan?

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?

  * Found out about Brendan McKay's new graph automorphism code http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/

  * Read up on monotonic lattice variables http://composition.al/

  * Reminded me of a monotonic magma discussion by the Twitter folks

  *No response back on request to math stackexchange on what these magmas are called. http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/527270/proper-term-for-a-monotonic-magma

  * Finally got around to coding up linear time select in Ruby https://gist.github.com/chadbrewbaker/7202412

  * Question? How can we replace the list.each_slice(5){ |s|  median_list.push(median_5(s))} to use a lazy enumerable that takes less space

  * Played around with some old suffix array ideas after the inspiration of getting the linear search working.

  * Watched a few of Wadler's Haskell talks

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?



## (4) What is your plan for next week?

  *  Git repo for WATIR talk

  *  More research on lazy enumerables

  *  Finish Wadler talks

  *  More progress on the transformation combinatorics project. Probably graph visualization.

  * Get in touch with Chuck about SICP plans

## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

* Iowa Ruby Brigade talk in December on WATIR ;need to make a git repo for the kata and slides
* Still no CFP for @RubyMidwest yet
* ICPP deadline in March
