# Weekly report, week 5 of 2015

## (1) What did you PLAN TO accomplish this week [in research]?
   * Read up on cites in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denotational_semantics looking for semantics based on endofunctions
   * Understand http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/06/17/exponentials-currying-and-universal-constructions/
   * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition.
   * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
   * Write up the list of questions KS wanted.
   * Some Rubycheck code
   * Some cppcheck code 
 

## (2) What DID you accomplish this week?
   *Read up on Conal and Bartos' stuff.
   *Figured out how to get lambdas to generate arbitirary vecrors in cppcheck
   *Burned a day trying to get Kythe to build. Solution seems to be fresh VM
   *Started an iOS static directory app
   *Listened to an Eric Evans DDD talk


## (2a) What questions did you come up with?
  * Could Kythe be used to come up with Lattix style dependency matrix views?
  * Would gcov dependency matrix views be useful?
  * Would generative mocks be usefull?   
  * Any useful category theory to be extracted from Eric Evans DDD?
 

## (3) What problems or issues arose, and how did you attempt to resolve them?
   * iOS overload. Just rolling with it until I get the app out.
   * I think I decided not to integrate rubycheck with minitest. Better as a standalone.
   * Ran into a need for an XML to graphviz converter in Ruby or xsltproc
   * Yak shave of setting up a new VM for QT dev.


## (4) What is your plan for next week?
   * iOS dev to get the app out of the way
   * Actual coding on the min detection set for iterated endomorphisms. At minimum get the connected components to color classes and test if my intuition that each corresponds to a unique labeled partition. 
   * Add at least one species to Claesson's library
   * Annotate more species on paper
   * Meet up with KS
   * Some Rubycheck code
   * Some cppcheck code 


## (5) How does that fit into your long-term plan [often a paper target]?

  * UNL automated test conference with deadline in May? TDD with Combinatorial Species : Generating complex tests with good coverage in a few lines of code. 
  * Two notes? One on polyBernouli species and one on endofunction detection?
